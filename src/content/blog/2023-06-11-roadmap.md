The following are some potential features that are being considered as enhancements to this starter. Please consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/hellotham) us if these features are important to you and you would like them to be implemented sooner. Alternately, if you want to implement any of these features, please let us know and we will be happy to support you!

- Include Markdoc support
- Convert from Tailwind to UnoCSS
- Convert from using yarn to pnpm
- Lazyload images

Current issues:

- Better support for Mermaid (awaiting possible official integration by Astro)
- Should really use load Mermaid and Markmap scripts from packages rather than external CDN.
