## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside this starter, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/

Astro looks for `.astro`, `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

`src/components/` is where we put any Astro components and similarly `src/layouts/` for layouts.

Images can be placed in `src/images/` or `src/svg/` depending on type.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
